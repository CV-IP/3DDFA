This is a simple c++ implementation to use the proposed method for detecting facial landmarks.</br>
<b>Main Points to be considered:</b></br>
<ul>
  <li>The implementation is not optimized.</li>
  <li>The model has been changed to ONNX <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i6sYwn79z1ko7JaeP44vIlJiF7yJ1BCv">get it.</a></li>
  <li>The requirements are just OpenCV <b>"tested on Opencv 4.2.0"</b></li>
  <li>Yolo has been used instead of Dlib for face detection.</li>
</ul>  
I hope that i will have time to complete all functionality and not just facial landmarks but i am sure that from here it is not hard to be implemented.</br>
Great thanks to the original author for the amazing job.
